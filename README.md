Explanation
Initialization: The contract initializes with no specific setup needed. This is done in the init function.

Token Exchange Endpoint (exchangeStoneForOre):

Users send 20 "STONE" tokens to exchange for 1 "ORE" token.
The contract verifies that the correct amount of "STONE" is sent.
The tokens are burned by sending them to a zero address. This is a conceptual placeholder; actual burning would require interaction with the token's contract.
Claiming Endpoint (claimOre):

Users can claim their "ORE" token after the exchange.
The contract checks that there is an ORE token available for the user to claim.
ORE Minting:

The issue_ore function is a placeholder for minting the "ORE" token. This would require implementing logic to interact with a token standard to create and assign the token to the user.
State Management:

pending_ore: Tracks the number of "ORE" tokens pending for each user, ensuring they can only claim what has been exchanged.
